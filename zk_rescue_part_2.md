# ZK Rescue Part 2

## Challenge
> Hey it's me, Red. In today's fast-paced jungle, where communication can be as intricate as the pages of a book, the real art of understanding is to read between the lines, and not just hear what people say. I remember hearing this wisdom from an old man in India 31 years ago, just before I visited the Louvre in Paris. Much like the Louvre's many artworks, people's true meanings and intentions are often hidden beneath the surface, waiting to be uncovered. What you did to get the first flag can also be done in other places, just need to lookup.

This was a continuation of the ZK Rescue challenge. I had no idea how to solve this.

After the CTF, I came to know that the flag was "BALOO." Baloo, in addition to being a [ZK proof system](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1565.pdf), is also a character from the classic tale, The Jungle Book. Looking back, I think the subtle hints from Red's message, "jungle" and "book," were meant to lead us towards this answer. However, I'm still not entirely sure if this was supposed to be the only hint. Some teams managed to brute force their way to the solution by putting in all the decoded strings from the polynomial evaluations.
